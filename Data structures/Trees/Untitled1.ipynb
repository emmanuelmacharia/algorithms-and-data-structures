    "# Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are non-linear herarchical data structures with nodes. \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "A collection of entities called Nodes, that are connected by edges. Each node contains a value and may or may not have a child node.\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "The edge are important parts of the trees because they manage the relationshipd between nodes\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of having trees is that different tree structures allow for quicker and easier access to the data - this can greatly reduce the time complexity of traversal/insertion/deletion since it isnt necessarily dependent on the size of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree has exactly ine path between two nodes; you cant have more than that\n",

    "## terminologies\n",
    "**Path:** \n",
    "Referse to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree. <br />\n",
    "**Root:**\n",
    "The top most node of a tree; there is only one root per tree and one path froom the root node to any node within the tree <br />\n",
    "**Parent:**\n",
    "Any node except the root node that has an edge to a child node <br />\n",
    "**Child:**\n",
    "A node that has a parent <br />\n",
    "**Leaf:**\n",
    "A node withiyt a child node in the tree <br />\n",
    "**Height:**\n",
    "The Longest path to a leaf <br />\n",
    "**Depth:**\n",
    "The length of the path to its root <br />\n",
    "**Subtree:**\n",
    "Represents the decendants of a node <br />\n",
    "**Visiting:**\n",
    "Checking the value of a node when control is on the node <br />\n",
    "**Traversing:**\n",
    "Going through the nodes in a specific order <br />\n",
    "**levels:**\n",
    "The level of a node represents the generation of the node. If the root node is at level 0, then the next child is at level 1 and the grandchild is at level 2 and so on. <br />\n",
    "**keys:**\n",
    "Represent a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out\n",

    "\n",
    "## Binary trees\n",
    "A type of tree where each node has no more that 2 child nodes\n",
    "It has the benefit of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion/deletion is as fast as in a linked list\n",
    "Every node in a binary tree has three properties:\n",
    "- A value\n",
    "- A left child\n",
    "- A right child\n",
