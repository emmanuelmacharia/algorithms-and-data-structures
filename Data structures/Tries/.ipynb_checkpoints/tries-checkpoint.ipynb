    "Using Trie, search complexities can be brought down to optimal (key length).\n",
    "If we store keys in binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proportional to <code> M * log N </code> where ***M*** is maximum string length andd N is number of keys in trees. <br />\n",
    "Using Trie, we can search the key inn O(M) time. However, the penalty is on Trie storage requirements.\n",

    "Every node of Trie consists of multiple branches. Each branch represents a possible character of keys. We need to mark the last node of every key as end ogf the word node. A trie node field is ***endOfWord*** is used to distinguish the node as the end of word node.\n",
